# Web-Scraping-With-Pandas-in-Jupyternotebook

# Project Overview
This project focuses on utilizing Python for web scraping, data extraction, and structured data analysis. The main goal is to gather information about football (soccer) matches from web sources and organize it into a pandas DataFrame for additional analysis and modeling.

Match information, teams, scores, outcomes, and betting-related statistics—all of which are frequently utilized in sports analytics and predictive modeling—are included in the scraped dataset. The study shows how unprocessed HTML data may be transformed into a clear, tabular format appropriate for machine learning, data science, and visualization applications.

Large datasets in Jupyter Notebook are handled with particular care, including handling truncated outputs (...) and utilizing pandas configuration settings to optimize data display.
The scraped dataset includes match details, teams, scores, results, and betting-related statistics, which are commonly used in sports analytics and predictive modeling. The project demonstrates how raw HTML data can be converted into a clean, tabular format suitable for data science, visualization, and machine learning applications.
Special attention is given to handling large datasets in Jupyter Notebook, including managing truncated outputs (...) and optimizing data display using pandas configuration options.

## Project Objectives
* Scrape structured data from a football statistics website
* Parse and clean HTML content using Python
* Store extracted data in a pandas DataFrame
* Handle large datasets efficiently in Jupyter Notebook
* Prepare the dataset for exploratory data analysis and modeling

### Technologies Used

*Python
*Jupyter Notebook
*pandas – data manipulation and analysis
*requests – fetching web content
*BeautifulSoup (bs4) – HTML parsing and data extraction

### Dataset Description
*The final dataset contains multiple football match attributes, including:
*League & Season Information
*Match Date and Time
*Home and Away Teams
*Full-Time and Half-Time Goals
*Match Results (Win/Draw/Loss)
*Betting Odds and Averages
